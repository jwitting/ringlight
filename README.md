# ringlight
A twist on the Adafruit ringlight project, adding some additional color control

The adafruit project (https://learn.adafruit.com/3d-printed-camera-led-ring/circuit-diagram) was my starting point, but I decided to add a button so that I would be able to quickly cycle through colors if i wanted.

Button debounce code, sourced from (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Debounce) was added as well.
